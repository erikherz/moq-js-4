# Issues

Yeah so there's a lot of work to do.

This is an early PoC and hobby project, so expect nothing to work. This page is a summary of the major issues, updated periodically.

# Web

See the [moq-js](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues) issues for a full list. There's a lot of small things that won't make it here.

#### General

|                                                issue | name                        | description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------: | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [#54](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/54) | WebTransport - Safari       | No Safari support yet. Webkit has expressed [public support](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/18#issuecomment-1495890122) so it will likely show up one day. |
| [#55](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/55) | WebCodecs - Firefox         | No Firefox support yet. Firefox has marked it [worth prototyping](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/209) but I haven't heard any updates.                    |
| [#56](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/56) | WebCodecs - Multiple Tracks | You can't add/remove tracks once the broadcast has started, such as to change input device or screen share.                                                                      |
| [#13](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/13) | WebCodecs - Codec Support   | WebCodecs supports a lot of codecs, but they need to be configured and packaged into MP4.                                                                                        |
| [#57](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/57) | UI - Make it Pretty         | Unfortunately, I'm not an artist.                                                                                                                                                |

#### Playback

|                                                issue | name                        | description                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------: | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   [#6](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/6) | WebCodecs - Controls        | There are no player controls. Even a volume slider would be great.                            |
|   [#9](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/9) | WebCodecs - Jitter Buffer   | Received frames are rendered ASAP. The user experience could be improved with a small buffer. |
| [#58](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/58) | WebCodecs - Synchronization | Audio and video are rendered out-of-sync. This is surprisingly difficult to implement.        |
| [#59](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/59) | MSE - Player                | There's a backup MSE player for Firefox but it needs more love.                               |

#### Publishing

| ---------------------------------------------------: | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [#60](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/60) | WebTransport - Prioritization     | Media should be prioritized by the sender during congestion. Use [priority hints](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransportsendstreamoptions-sendorder) when implemented. |
| [#61](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/61) | WebTransport - Congestion Control | Reno/CUBIC (default) suffers from buffer bloat. Use [congestion control hints](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransport-congestioncontrol) when implemented.             |
| [#62](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/62) | WebCodecs - Echo Cancelation      | We need to support bidirectional broadcasts and rooms, which means echo cancellation.                                                                                                |
| [#49](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js/issues/49) | UI - Public Broadcasts            | We should have a way to publish and list public broadcasts.                                                                                                                          |

# Native

See the [moq-rs](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues) issues for a full list. There's a lot of small things that won't make it here.

#### General

|                                                  issue | name                       | description                                                                                                                                                    |
| -----------------------------------------------------: | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   [#29](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues/29) | Quinn - Congestion Control | Quinn experimentally supports BBR but it needs to be validated and possibly tweaked.                                                                           |
| [#104](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues/104) | Quinn - Tracing            | Quinn lacks the tracing required to validate the user experience. We should add [qlog](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/issues/406) and other useful metrics. |

| -----------------------------------------------------: | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   [#63](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues/63) | libmoq - C Bindings | Make a C library to interface with moq-rs.                                                                     |
| [#105](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues/105) | libmoq - OBS        | Develop an [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) plugin.                                                              |
| [#106](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues/106) | libmoq - ffmpeg     | Develop an [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) plugin. Piping to stdin currently works but it could be improved. |
| [#107](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues/107) | libmoq - GStreamer  | Develop a [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) plugin.                                              |

#### Relay

|                                                  issue | name                  | description                                                                                                                                  |
| -----------------------------------------------------: | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [#108](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues/108) | Relay - Cache Network | The relays form a mesh network. This won't scale past a few nodes.                                                                           |
| [#109](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues/109) | Relay - Observability | There's no logging, metrics, or even health checks. I don't even know if the site is up.                                                     |
| [#110](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues/110) | Relay - Scaling       | Everything is in [terraform](https://github.com/kixelated/quic.video) but otherwise everything is manual, including the number of instances. |
| [#111](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs/issues/111) | Relay - Pool Sessions | Clients establish a QUIC connection per broadcast. We should investigate reusing connections via ANNOUNCE like the specification intends.    |

# Protocol

Gotta argue at the next [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) and/or [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) meeting about these ones.

| name                         | description                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| QUIC - Congestion Congestion | QUIC needs an extension in order to match WebRTC's transport-wide-cc.                                           |
| Transport - Catalog          | MoQ wll use a JSON catalog to describe the available tracks, but it needs some more work.                       |
| Transport - Containers       | MoQ supports fMP4 at the moment, but it introduces quite a bit of overhead.                                     |
| Transport - Feedback         | There's no way to signal that a downstream is encountering congestion. This would be useful for 1:1 broadcasts. |
