**Media over QUIC** is new live media protocol powered by [QUIC](https://quicwg.org/):
a super-charged TCP/UDP replacement designed for [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3).
It's being developed by the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) as a new standard.

<p class="tagline">Try it out! [Watch](/watch) or [Publish](/publish) a broadcast</p>

Everything is a work in progress, but some features include:

-   Web support via [WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport) and [WebCodecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API)
-   CDN support via [MoqTransport](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-transport/).
-   Native support with ffmpeg and OBS plugins. [(in development)](/issues)

<p class="tagline">Fully [open source](/source) demo and library</p>

The native components are in [Rust](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-rs) and the web components are in [Typescript](https://github.com/kixelated/moq-js).

We are designing a protocol that is simple and yet flexible enough to support the wide range of use-cases:
from ultra-low latency to ultra-high quality, 1 viewer to 1 million viewers, contribution and distribution, and everything in between.
See the [motivation](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-moq-transport-01.html#name-motivation) for more information.

MoQ is still very early in development and many features are missing.
Everything is liable to change, especially if you get involved!

The protocol is being developed by the
[IETF MoQ working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/about/). The
[IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) is an open organization that develops Internet standards, including
some of your _favorite_ protocols like HTTP, TLS, and DNS.

**Note:** This is not an official IETF website, nor does the MoQ working group endorse this website.
The standard is being produced by many individuals from companies such as Google, Meta, Cisco, Akamai, etc.
